# AI-Based-System-for-Keyword-Analysis-Fake-News-Detection

This project, suggested by KPITB, requires developing models to analyze keywords relevant to law enforcement, focusing on content that may incite unrest or violence. Key system requirements include the ability to flag such content and assign government officers to take necessary actions. Additionally, the system will need Urdu-to-English translation capabilities and training models for Pashto to enhance local language support.
